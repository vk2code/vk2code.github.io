                    <h1>Naruto Poster</h1>
                    <p>This is a poster I made on Photoshop 2024 about my favourite anime Naruto! This took me almost 4 weeks and was a lot of drawing and erasing as I used only the brush tool and my drawing pad. This was also my first big digital drawing.</p>

                    <h1>Peace Eclipse Poster</h1>
                    <p>This is a poster I made about a story I made on my own. I used the same background for this as the Naruto poster, but I kind of wanted to remake that poster using my own story which I think I did correctly. This took me one whole day which shows how much I progressed from my first time digitally drawing.</p>

                    <h1>Character Design</h1>
                    <p>This was first attempt at doing a full character design in general! I used Photoshop again and was my first time drawing a body. The goal of this drawing was to draw a pugnacious, large, and muscular character with similar features as me but also a fictional look. I tried to do the best I could and given this was my first time I think I did really good. This took me around a day.</p>

                    <h1>Naruto Edit</h1>
                    <p>This was one of my first times using Premiere Pro 2024 and I decided to make the edits that have been trending on all of social media. Of course I did it on Naruto, but it's villains. This took the whole day but it was very difficult to do.</p>
